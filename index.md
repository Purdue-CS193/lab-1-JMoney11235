#JMoney11235's first CS193 Lab


- I like the consistency of GitHub servers (jk.. lol)
- I like that we have a small class size
- I like that we have pretty chill TA's
- I like the chairs in Lawson that I'll get to sit in every lab
- I don't like people who make bulleted lists that have 6 items in them
- I don't like hypocrits
